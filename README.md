rails-fit-blog
==============

A blog built to explore Ruby on Rails and attempt to use the FitBit API.

### August 7, 2013

This project is an attempt to build a blog as my first full trip through the Rails Framework. I'm a 
little nutty about fitness trackers, so I'm going to try to include some features from the FitBit API, as well.

The basic idea would be to create a blog that features a daily post about my general activity level for a day, and 
pull information from my Fitbit account, and present it in some interesting way along with the post (maybe using 
jQuery or some nice UI hooks for simple data visualization).
